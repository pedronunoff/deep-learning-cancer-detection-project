# Deep Learning: detecting skin cancer from images

This project was developed for the Deep Learning course in the Master's Degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics (NOVA IMS).

The main goal was to use image only data (pictures) to do multiclass classification of types of skin cancer. We used tensorflow and were required to build the Neural Networks "by hand", starting from a chosen architecture and experimenting with various parts of it (kernel sizes, numbers of layers, types of layers, ...). All code is in python.

## Main steps

- Data exploration
- Preprocessing with image noise reduction, oversampling, data augmentation
- "Handcrafting" multiple different models (guided by the ResNet architecture) and assessing their quality
- Hyperparameter tuning and comparing the best models
- A small dip into transfer learning.
